Elevator pitch: My application, "FoodShare", connects local restaurants with food banks to help reduce food waste and fight hunger. With the click of a button, restaurants can donate their excess food to a nearby food bank, providing nutritious meals for those in need. FoodShare is not only a socially responsible solution to food waste, but also a convenient and easy way for restaurants to give back to their communities.

Key features for FoodShare:

1. Secure login over HTTPS to protect user information and prevent unauthorized access.
2. Easy-to-use interface for restaurants to quickly and easily donate their excess food to local food banks.
3. Display of nearby food banks and their specific needs, allowing restaurants to make targeted donations.
4. Real-time tracking of donations and impact, showing how much food has been donated and how many meals have been provided.
5. Ability for food banks to leave feedback and thank restaurants for their donations.
6. Option for restaurants to schedule recurring donations to help food banks plan ahead.
7. Integration with social media platforms to promote community involvement and raise awareness of food waste and hunger issues.
