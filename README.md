Elevator pitch: Our application, "FoodShare", connects local restaurants with food banks to help reduce food waste and fight hunger. With the click of a button, restaurants can donate their excess food to a nearby food bank, providing nutritious meals for those in need. FoodShare is not only a socially responsible solution to food waste, but also a convenient and easy way for restaurants to give back to their communities.
